Itâ€™s (j)ust (e)leventy and (t)ailwind â€¦Â OK, and a few other things; itâ€™s still *really* small though.

## Goal
[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) are a perfect melt to keep things simple but powerful.

While learning how to use Eleventy, I came across [a few starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) that combine it with Tailwind CSS, which is _amazing_, but they also come with so much more.

Personally, I _only_ want Eleventy and Tailwind â€¦Â and, taking the desire for simplicity one step further, I only want to use them via NPM scripts.
